# Preparing for the backcountry:

Ready to put action to all those plans?

> Well, for starters, I'm gonna need a good radio station. Something that goes on and on for hours, keeps me upbeat and on-task. If you've planned a long backcountry adventure, there are a thousand details staring you in the face, and getting lost in the minutia is not just possible, it's an environmental hazard.

Better take a tiny step than fret. Yep, it's overwhelming. Let's crank up the tunes.

_**Day 1 Preparations**_

Designate a large, clear area to sort that gear. Lay out your trip preparation lists. Say what? You don't have these? Here's a great place to start if you are dreaming of making one these backcountry canoe adventures a reality (http://www.algonquinpark.on.ca/visit/camping/backcountry-canoe-trip-equipment.php). In my opinion, their leave no trace philosophy is elevated to the standard we must commit to meet.

Putting it on paper makes it real, and manageable. I, for one, can't get by thinking, "I'll just put all the tent stuff over here..." and, "I can pile the kitchen supplies here with my mess kit." Because, I will get out there. I will be enthusiastically out there in the unreachable, utter reaches of our first tent site, and I'll discover that rocks make terrible tent stakes. Or, that shiny new fuel canister has no actual fuel to cook my food. You see my dilemma.

Music distraction in place? Check.

Sorting space cleared? Check.

Preparatory lists out? Check.

Wait! Panic-y thoughts of preparing for the backcountry crop up. What do we need if it drops below freezing, will we take enough food, what if we run across a hungry bear (how big is an adult moose, anyway) and what if we get too much rain, and then wake in a soggy sleeping bag, with wet socks, will hypothermia slowly seep in...?

Stop that! This is the trip of a lifetime! We've been talking of this and planning for years. (Truthfully, that planning is just now getting focused, and is the likely source of my anxiety.)

Wait! Procrastinate. Do a little more research. Read more about the ticks that cause lyme's disease. Did I buy that tick removal key doodad? Does dehydrated food give me enough fiber in my diet to avoid unpleasant consequences? It's easier to trial off on a research binge than actually begin to pack.

Ack! What do I pack all of these supplies IN? Ditty bags in larger sacks in compression sacks in a dry bag? Does the dry bag do the work for all of them? If this huge 65-liter dry bag is really waterproof, I don't have to worry about my underwear getting soaked if we topple the canoe. It's not like I can just roll my little lightweight samsonite knock-off suitcase up and into the belly of a round bottom canoe. How to stay organized? I don't want to reach into my bag just to slice my finger on my folded hand saw.

But, the dry sack is a huge, voluminous space...I won't have a clue where my underwear is. Underwear is really important if you don't enjoy the misery brought on by sweaty chaffing. How do you sort kitchen from sundries in a barrel-shaped dry sack?

Now, I have a cleared surface with 4 dry sacks neatly arranged and labeled with a note card (a temporary measure that may need to become a permanent label on the bag itself if the color itself is not intuitive). Red is food prep. Green for toiletries. Yellow for clothes.

Wait! Procrastinate. I just re-read that helpful bit on packing "the extras":

> "sturdy pocket knife is also a valuable tool; the large belt knives may look impressive, but since you will not be tackling anything more dangerous than a piece of salami, they are unnecessary. A simple repair kit consisting of electrical tape, safety pins, a short piece of wire, and a small pair of pliers will enable you to handle most problems that might develop with your equipment. People using fiberglass canoes may want to include a proper fiberglass patch kit; those using canvas canoes may wish to add canvas and waterproof glue to their repair kit."

Oh hell. I would have completely forgotten about a general repair kit. What bag should l pack that stuff inside? Which dry sack does it go into? I look at my machete, and decide that perhaps it is better for another adventure. I need a "small pocket knife" as a handy tool. And pliers. Should those be in the same multi-tool? How heavy is that going to be? Ugh.

Now, I procrastinate by using the bathroom. Wait! How do I use the backcountry facilities under the "leave no trace" rules? I want to be a good steward of my environment, and I know I'm not the only one passing through these wilderness trails. I slow my roll to read a highly responsible, very well-written article here: http://www.trailspace.com/articles/backcountry-waste-disposal.html

This young gentleman wrote a enlightening summary of his rather clever product:

Day 2 _**Preparations**_

I wake up at dawn on my birthday. I'm serious about this now. If I don't accomplish something significant today, I will really be disappointed. I start tossing gear from all of it's hiding places (old gear in the closet, sleeping bag hanging over it's hanger, fry pan on the shelf, fire starter kits and super-wool socks and healing salve...obtained after reading magazine articles and purchased online...these things are stuffed in nooks and crannies all around the house).

I find our base and mid layers, lay out my jacket and rain gear, trying to make note of the parts that need a little repair/cleaning. Wool socks. Boots, that need more waterproofing. Gaitors...do we want to stomp around in these on this journey? Gloves. Do we take a set each for warmth and another to handle bushcraft needs? I wonder what lumberjack coolness we can capture on HD video in slow-motion as I split a sliver of kindling off from it's poised wedge with my swedish ax. I wonder if we'll need firewood at all in the backcountry, or would it be safest to use minimal stove fuels? We're going to be completely off-grid, in the boonies, self-reliant and many miles/hours from any kind of cellular signal or sign of human existence. We have maps, and a really keen compass.

I've suddenly been reminded that I need to download the software for our fancy GPS satellite locator. I have to create e-mail logins, register, download apps for the camera and smart phone to coordinate with the GPS and sync to the computer. And, all this has to be powered by a charged drive powered by lightweight, bendable, scratch-resistant, water-proof solar panels.   
This is distractive! Gear is strewn all over, and I am now sitting in front of the computer verifying log-ins and reading about upgrading my micro SD memory card so I can take more photos. But, here's the rub: my photos will be GPS-located and tagged, coordinated, marked with my heart rate, walking pace, altitude and terminal velocity (if I so desire!) so viewers can feel vicariously close to the situation. This is wild!

This is a warning flag. I've clearly run off on a tangent. I've lost my track completely. Let's do a reality check: does anyone really need to know that my heart is pounding out at 185 beats per minute because I've moved from 2 to 3 miles per hour portaging down this trail and the altitude has only increased by 128.4 feet?

Whew! I'm dangerously close to procrastinating again.

_**I'm already lost**_, and I'm nowhere near the wilderness.

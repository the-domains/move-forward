# Breadcrumbs...

Breadcrumbs is a humble effort between two happily married ol' hags to make meaningful blogs as they adventure outdoors. Initially, we'll explore the American wilderness, National Parks and the paths less traveled in little towns. We aim to meet loads of spectacular people and share with our readers the ups & downs of the experience as a whole.

Dana, an Emergency RN and Licensed Paramedic, will be posting technical camping gear reviews and fulltimer RV experiences from our traveling canine companions' pet-spective.

Heather, a Physical Therapist Assistant, will address trip-planning, and funding such adventures by working on the road, (travelers, as medical professionals).

Please check in to learn along with us. We are honored to have you along!
